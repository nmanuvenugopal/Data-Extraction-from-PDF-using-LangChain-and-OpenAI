For extracting the data from the PDF I have used the **PyMuPDFLoader** library.
I have done the following task in this scenario:
1. Extract the texts from the PDF by using PyMuPDFLoader.
2. Split the tesxt using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
3. After splitting the text I have embedded the texts using the OpenAIEmbedding model.
4. Once everything is embedded, FAISS is used for storing and indexing purposes.
5. ChatOpenAI model is used query and retrive the correct information from vector database based on user query.
6. For retrieval puposes, I have used the RetrievalQA of LangChain chain.
